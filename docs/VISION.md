**Vision Statement**

SickNasty is an online community platform that will allow users to create and share content (pictures, videos, or text) to their own personal page, or a specific community group.

SickNasty is meant to be used by people who want to join communities and meet new people through their hobbies. Users can find inspiration, get new ideas from like-minded people, or just use it to kill time. We want to draw in creative people by giving them a space to flourish, people who want to learn by asking questions, and those looking for others to socialize with. We aspire to provide a space for users who want to share their content for others to enjoy. 
 
The goal is to provide a platform where users can communicate their interests. Users can “follow” a community or individual users to see the content that they share within the app. This will allow them to see content from people and communities they like, and things they aren’t interested won’t show up unless they search for it. People will also be able to share images, videos to either their own personal page or to a community in the app. The users who are a part of the community will be able to see the content that is shared on the community’s personal page. 

Users will also be able to create a community group, based on any topic they desire, where any other user can join and share content. Furthermore, SickNasty can also help people get answers to specific questions by asking them in a community related to those questions. It also gives other users that are knowledgeable in that specific topic the ability to engage in a discussion and work towards the root of the problem.

We consider SickNasty to be valuable because users will be able to share content on their personal page to show a bit of their personality, and interests, while also being able to keep up with various communities and connect with people all around the world. It also allows individuals to build their networks and be more active in their social circles. Furthermore, SickNasty enables the wide-spread sharing of knowledge, ideas, humourous content, and other various things. Anyone can browse the diverse communities and engage in conversation with people globally. People can get satisfaction from sharing content by receiving feedback from others and can give their feedback (In the form of “Likes”, where people appreciate something they’ve shared) on other people's content.
 
The system is envisioned to be an android app. After initial release, we will consider expanding to an iOS and web release.

The success of this project will be determined by 3 criteria as follows. First, if users can easily share content to the platform. Second, if new users can easily find and join communities as soon as they create an account. Finally, if, after launch, user retention is at least 20% in the following 6 months after release.
